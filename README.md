# Sudoku Solver

This will solve Sudokus using a backtracking method without function recursion.
When I started working on this, I didn't know that we could use this, and instead built a custom stack.
For larger solves, this appear to be faster anyway, so keeping it this way.

This also includes a really slow, but in my opinion pretty cool visualizer.

Next version will include command line args to run this is a better way.
